# AnaMorf

AnaMorf is a plug-in developed for the [FIJI/ImageJ](http://fiji.sc/) platform to analyse the microscopic morphology of filamentous microbes. The program returns average data on a population of mycelial elements, using the descriptors projected area, circularity, total hyphal length, number of hyphal tips, hyphal growth unit, lacunarity and fractal dimension. The plug-in accepts as input a user-specified directory of images, analysing each and outputing tabulated results.

For details on installation and use, see the [wiki](https://github.com/djpbarry/AnaMorf/wiki).
